# Prerequisites


## Platform

In different platform, there are some differences in the most appropriate installation method.

- `Windows`: We recommend installing the [`wsl` subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and installing `conda` in the wsl subsystem to configure the omicverse environment.
- `Linux`: We can choose to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), and then use conda to configure the omicverse environment
- `Mac Os`: We recommend using [`miniforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or [`mambaforge`](https://www.rho-signal-effective-analytics.com/modules/pre-course/miniconda-installation/)to configure.
